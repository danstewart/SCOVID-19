## Archived scovid19.xyz code

New code: https://github.com/danstewart/scovid19.xyz


This repo contains the first two version of the site.

#### Python Scraper
This was the initial version which scraped the stats from the gov.scot site each day using Beautiful Soup and pre built a static website with Jinja templates.  
It was cool at first but the scraper broke pretty much daily.  

#### Perl Mojo
This was the first rewrite to use the NHS OpenData API and was written in Perl with Mojolicious.  
I have now rewrote this in Python to gain more exposure in other languages.
